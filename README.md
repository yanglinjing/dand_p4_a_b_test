## Project Overview

In this project, I analysed the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.

The purpose is to understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

+ An A/B test is run to compare the converted rate of the new / old page.
+ A logistic regression is used to compare interaction of the countries and A/B pages.
